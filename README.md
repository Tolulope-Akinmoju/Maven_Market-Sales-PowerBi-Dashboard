# Summary
Maven Market is a multi-national grocery chain with locations in Canada, Mexico and the United States. In this report,I worked through the entire business intelligence workflow: connecting and shaping the source data, building a relational model, adding calculated columns and measures, and then finalling, I  designed an interactive report using PowerBI.
